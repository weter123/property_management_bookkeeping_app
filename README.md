## Development Log
2024-03-04: Over the past month, I have been learning how to use .NET Maui and applied what I learned to this project. I have implemented MVVM Pattern to the project and fixed issue with page navigation. the current goal will be to modify the current features with better UI options and setup unit testing before adding new features. 

2024-03-10: since last log update, only small updates were made to the project. this is because I tired to introduce unit testing to the project using XUnit. however, I could not progress far into it because I had limited knowlege on Unit Test development. Currently, I am taking a course on how to use xUnit and research how to devlop unit test for Commands that call SQL Databases.
